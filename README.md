                 CyberScan Pro (v1.0) - Lightning-Fast Port Scanner with Advanced Features



A CyberScan Pro is an advanced application crafted to explore servers or hosts for open ports. This tool aids administrators in verifying network security policies and assists attackers in identifying network services on a host to exploit vulnerabilities.

CyberScan Pro is a streamlined tool developed by -s_j, designed to swiftly scan and uncover open ports within any network. It efficiently scans 1 to 65K ports in 10 seconds on your targeted IP.

Featuring:

Asynchronous Scanning: Harnesses libraries like asyncio or twisted for concurrent scanning, drastically enhancing speed.
Multithreading or Multiprocessing: Utilizes multiple CPU cores to parallelize the scanning process, boosting overall performance.
User Interface: Equipped with a sleek graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython for enhanced user experience.
Port Identification: Identifies common services on open ports by analyzing response data, offering insights into available services.
Service Enumeration: Extends scanning capabilities to gather detailed information such as banner grabs, service versions, and potential vulnerabilities.
IP Range Scanning: Enables scanning of IP address ranges or CIDR blocks, allowing simultaneous scanning of multiple hosts.
Advanced Logging and Reporting: Enhances logging with detailed reports, including timestamps, scan duration, identified services, and encountered errors.
Configurability: Provides options to customize scan parameters like timeout values, scan intensity, and output formats to suit different preferences.
Integration with Threat Intelligence: Seamlessly integrates with threat intelligence feeds or databases to identify known malicious IP addresses or services.
Security Measures: Implements security measures such as rate limiting, input validation, and authentication to prevent misuse and unauthorized access.
